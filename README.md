### Calories tracker web app
* The user must be able to create an account and log in
* When logged in, the user can see a list of his meals and calories (the user enters calories manually, no auto calculations), and should be able to edit and delete
* Each entry has a date, time, text, and number of calories
* Filter by dates from-to, time from-to (e.g., how much calories have I had for lunch each day in the last month, if lunch is between 12:00 and 15:00)
* User setting â€“ Expected number of calories per day: When displayed, it goes green if the total for that day is less than the expected number of calories per day, otherwise goes red
* The back-end must be in Ruby on Rails
* Minimal UI/UX design is needed
* Most actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable
* REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication.
* Write tests! Decide which areas are worth testing and which kind of tests (unit, integration etc.) to utilize.
